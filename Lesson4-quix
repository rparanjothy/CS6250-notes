 True
False

Question 2
1 / 1 pts
An Autonomous System operates across multiple administrative domains.  
 True
False

Question 3
1 / 1 pts
For two ASes to form a peering agreement, they need to find common ground regarding the internal policies and traffic engineering approaches that each AS implements.  
 True
False

Question 4
1 / 1 pts
A Content Distribution Network (CDN) or an ISP can operate over multiple Autonomous Systems.
True
False

Question 5
1 / 1 pts
Consider the figure below that denotes ASes and their relationships.

Note: C1, C2, C3 are customers of ISP-X. ISP-P is a provider of ISP-X.

True
False

Question 6
1 / 1 pts

ISP-X has the incentive to advertise the routes for Pâ€™s customers to Y and Z.

True
False

Question 7
1 / 1 pts
Consider the figure below:

Note: C1, C2, C3 are customers of ISP-X. ISP-P is a provider of ISP-X.

ISPs-1.jpg

Assume that AS-X learns multiple routes for the same external destination W. These multiple routes are advertised from C3, from Y and from P. How would AS-X rank these routes before deciding which one to import?

1. route learned from C3, 2) route learned from Y, 3) route learned from P.
1. route learned from Y, 2) route learned from C3, 3) route learned from P.
1. route learned from P, 2) route learned from Y, 3) route learned from C3.

Question 8
1 / 1 pts

R-A1 <-> R-A3 : iBGP
R-B1 <-> R-A3 : eBGP
R-B3 <-> R-D2 : iBGP
R-D3 <-> R-D2 : eBGP

Question 9
1 / 1 pts
Assume that router R-D2 learns about a route to a destination in AS-A. How would router R-D2 disseminate this route to R-D3 and R-D1?

Screen Shot 2021-01-27 at 7.23.07 PM.png

Using iBGP.
Using eBGP.
Using IGP.

Question 10
1 / 1 pts
Assume that router R-D2 learns about a route to an internal destination in AS-D. How would router R-D2 disseminate this route to R-D3 and R-D1?

Question 11
1 / 1 pts
Assume that router R-B1 learns about a route to AS-C. How would router R-B1 disseminate this route to R-A3?

Using iBGP.
Using eBGP.
Using IGP.

Question 12
1 / 1 pts
Since the BGP path selection process is fixed, an AS has no control over which routes are selected.  
 True
False

Question 13
1 / 1 pts
Assume that AS-B learns about an external destination both from AS-C and from AS-A. AS-B can show preference to use the route heard from AS-C by assigning higher LocalPref value to that route.

Screen Shot 2021-01-27 at 7.23.07 PM.png

True
False

Question 14
1 / 1 pts
Assume that AS-B advertises the routes to its internal destination to AS-A using the routers R-B1 and R-B4. AS-B can communicate to AS-A that it prefers R-B1 as an entry point to the network, by assigning lower MED values to these routes.

Screen Shot 2021-01-27 at 7.23.07 PM.png

True
False

Question 15
1 / 1 pts
An AS can use LocalPref to control which routers are used as exit points (for the outgoing traffic), and it can use the MED attribute to control which routers are used as entry points (for the incoming traffic).  
 True
False

Question 16
1 / 1 pts
One of the services provided by IXPs is additional security protections such as mitigation of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.
True
False

Question 17
1 / 1 pts
There are no costs involved for an AS to participate at an IXP.  
 True
False

IncorrectQuestion 18
0 / 1 pts
Since local traffic stays local at IXPs, the IXP infrastructures deal with limited volumes of traffic.  
 True
False

Question 19
1 / 1 pts
When a large provider or Content Delivery Network joins an IXP, this can act as an incentive for other networks to join as well.  
 True
False

Question 20
1 / 1 pts
At an IXP, the members have the choice to peer privately or publicly.
True
False

Question 21
1 / 1 pts
IXPs leading incentive to establish route servers was to charge the participants for using it.  
 True
False

Question 22
1 / 1 pts
An IXP route server does not need to run the BGP protocol to facilitate the establishment of multi-lateral peering sessions.  
 True
False

Question 23
1 / 1 pts
For multi-lateral BGP peering sessions at an IXP, the participants have the choice to advertise routes, either directly to other participants, or to the route server.  
 True
False
